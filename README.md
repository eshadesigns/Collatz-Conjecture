# Collatz-Conjecture
Simple visualization of the Collatz Conjecture

The Collatz Conjecture is a mathematical conjecture that has been neither proven nor disproven.
It proposes that any positive integer will form a sequence that eventually reaches zero when applying only 2 simple rules

1. If the number is even, divide by 2
2. Else, if the number is odd, multiply by 3 and add 1

Example Output:
Enter a positive integer: 93
